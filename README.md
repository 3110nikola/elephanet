## Disclaimer

Elephanet relies on Firebase for authentication and other functionalities, **but for security reasons, the .env file containing sensitive information such as API keys is not uploaded**. As a result, **key features, including user registration, login, profile picture management, post creation, post deletion, liking posts, adding comments, and viewing users profiles may not be fully functional in the demo**. Elephanet is a personal project developed to **demonstrate my coding abilities** and understanding of front-end development, Firebase integration, and user interactions in a social media context.
